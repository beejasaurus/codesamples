codesamples - RockvilleTKD (US Royal Martial Arts)
===========

RockvilleTKD is mostly a static brochure type site. However, it required 3 PHP scripts. 2 for sending information vial forms to the owner's email address, and 1 for pulling images out of a directory.

Index.php
Shows PHP for pulling form data, sanitizing it, then emailing it. Unfortunately, the owner's server does not support PEAR, so I had to make it fairly basic.

Gallery.php
Shows PHP for doing a directory search to grab all the images in a specific folder, then formatting them in HTML.
